So to begin your coding journey, here are some things you'd need...

- **A strong will** so you don't quit
- **A brain** to understand things
- **Laptop and internet connection** to run the code and do research
- **Ability to google** so you copy code from StackOverflow
- **Patience** because this is gonna be a long ride

Still here? Ok let's moooooveeeeee!

# Code Blocks

Here is an example of a code block

```tsx showLineNumbers title="pages/blog/[slug].tsx" {5,12,20}
import { allPosts, type Post } from "contentlayer/generated"
import { type GetStaticProps, type InferGetStaticPropsType } from "next"

export const getStaticPaths = () => ({
  paths: allPosts.map((post) => ({ params: { slug: post.slug } })),
  fallback: false,
})

export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps<{
  post: Post
}> = ({ params }) => ({
  props: { post: allPosts.find((post) => post.slug === params?.slug) },
})

export default function SinglePostPage(
  props: InferGetStaticPropsType<typeof getStaticProps>,
) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{props.post.title}</h1>
    </div>
  )
}
```

# Fancy me fancy?

[Lorem Ipsum](https://www.lipsum.com/), is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

Here is how it works:

- Type `lorem` in your code editor
- Get freaky
- Get loremy

Some inline code

```js
const multiply = (a, b) => a * b
```

A very long useless HTML code

```html showLineNumbers
<div>
  <pre>
    <code>
      <span class="line">
        <span style="color:#C678DD">const</span>
        <span style="color:#ABB2BF"> </span>
        <span style="color:#61AFEF">multiply</span>
        <span style="color:#ABB2BF"> </span>
        <span style="color:#56B6C2">=</span>
        <span style="color:#ABB2BF"> (</span>
        <span style="color:#E06C75;font-style:italic">a</span>
        <span style="color:#ABB2BF">, </span>
        <span style="color:#E06C75;font-style:italic">b</span>
        <span style="color:#ABB2BF">) </span>
        <span style="color:#C678DD">=&gt;</span>
        <span style="color:#ABB2BF"> </span>
        <span style="color:#E06C75">a</span>
        <span style="color:#ABB2BF"> </span>
        <span style="color:#56B6C2">*</span>
        <span style="color:#ABB2BF"> </span>
        <span style="color:#E06C75">b</span>
      </span>
    </code>
  </pre>
</div>
```
